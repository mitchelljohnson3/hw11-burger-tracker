this app will allow the user to create burgers, and eat burgers.
the burgers are stored in a local mysql database.
the server can be set up and initialized by running the schema.sql and seeds.sql file
contained within the 'db' folder. Then connect to the app using a browser, going to 
the address of 'http://localhost:8080'

each burger on the left side of the screen will have a button named 'Devour it!'
when you press the button, it will move the burger to the other side of the screen,
showing that it has been devoured.
